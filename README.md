# TheEXPLORERGAME
In this project their is no any source code.
Working in unity is almost coding free because in unity you are provided assets, in assets all scripts are already present which are necessary for making a project or a game.
My game is also made with the help of assets which all are downloaded from assets store of unity and present in this file.
